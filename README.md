# Python_Code_Shapley_XAI_Regression

This code, written using Python programming, is for optimizing a Random Forest regression model using k-fold cross-validation from scikit-learn. The optimized model is then analyzed using explainable AI(XAI), in particular SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). This code and methodology is associated with the study "Using Explainable AI (XAI) to Assess the Potential of Satellite Remote Sensing for Estimating Active Layer Thickness (ALT)".
