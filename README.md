# Python Code: Shapley XAI Regression

This code, written using Python programming, is for optimizing a Random Forest regression model using k-fold cross-validation from scikit-learn. The optimized model is then analyzed using explainable AI(XAI), in particular SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
